# Graphen UI library

## Principles standing behind the structure

### Block Element Modifier
* Specificity should be flat
* Naming in BEM convention

### Object Oriented CSS
* Separate structure from skin
* Separate container from content

### Modified Atomic BEM
* Simple atomic blocks should be composed into complex ones (prefixes describe the group to which blocks belong) 
* Instead of atoms, modules and organisms - like in the standard Atomic pattern - atoms, components and modules are present (the reason behind this change is it reflects more business like approach) 

## How to use

### Out of the box approach
In a standard use case, ready skins might be used directly. 

### Customised approach
If a project requires more customised styles, generators (prefixed with `g`) should be used.

* Name of colors are taken from [here](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/)
