## Principles

Principles standing behind the project.

#### Block Element Modifier
* Specificity should be flat (to avoid specificity issues)
* Naming in BEM convention

#### Object Oriented CSS
* Separate structure from skin (higher code reusability)
* Separate container from content (higher code reusability)

#### Naming convention
* `c-*` - stands for **component** (context free block)
* `m-*` - stands for **mix** (generic modifier not assigned to a particular block or element)  

## Usage

#### Installation
1. Install as npm package (for now only from `github.com` directly)
2. Import `style.scss`into your project

## Others
* Name of colors are taken from [here](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/)
